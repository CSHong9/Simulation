# Simulation
The codes implements models in social and behavioral science studies. <br />
The model replications I have done include: <br />
1. Granovetter, Mark S. 1978. “Threshold Models of Collective Behavior.” American Journal of Sociology 83:1420-1433. <br />
2. Leik, Robert K. and Barbara F. Meeker. 1995. “Computer Simulation for Exploring Theories: Models of Interpersonal Cooperation and Competition.” Sociological Perspectives 38: 463-470.
